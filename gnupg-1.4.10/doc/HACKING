		      A Hacker's Guide to GNUPG
		   ================================
		   (Some notes on GNUPG internals.)


		   ===> Under construction <=======


CVS Access
==========

NOTE: CVS access has been disabled while we are migrating to Subversion.
Watch www.gnupg.org for instarctions on how to use the Subversion repository.

Anonymous read-only CVS access is available:

  cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.gnupg.org:/cvs/gnupg login

use the password "anoncvs".  To check out the the complete
archive use:

  cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.gnupg.org:/cvs/gnupg \
        checkout -R STABLE-BRANCH-1-0 gnupg

This service is provided to help you in hunting bugs and not to deliver
stable snapshots; it may happen that it even does not compile, so please
don't complain. CVS may put a high load on a server, so please don't poll
poll for new updates but wait for an announcement; to receive this you may
want to subscribe to:

    gnupg-commit-watchers@gnupg.org

by sending a mail with subject "subscribe" to

    gnupg-commit-watchers-request@gnupg.org


You must run scripts/autogen.sh before doing the ./configure,
as this creates some needed while which are not in the CVS.
autogen.sh should checks that you have all required tools
installed.


RSYNC access
============
The FTP archive is also available by anonymous rsync.  A daily snapshot
of the CVS head revision is also available.  See rsync(1) and try
"rsync ftp.gnupg.org::" to see available resources.



Special Tools
=============
Documentation is based on the docbook DTD.  Actually we have only the
man page for now.  To build a man page you need the docbook-to-man
tool and all the other thinks needed for SGML processing.  Debian
comes with the docbook tools and you only need this docbook-to-man
script which is comes with gtk-doc or download it from
ftp.openit.de:/pub/devel/sgml.	If you don't have it everything
should still work fine but you will have only a dummy man page.

Memory allocation
-----------------
Use only the functions:

    m_alloc()
    m_alloc_clear()
    m_strdup()
    m_free()

If you want to store a passphrase or some other sensitive data you may
want to use m_alloc_secure() instead of m_alloc(), as this puts the data
into a memory region which is protected from swapping (on some platforms).
m_free() works for both.  This functions will not return if there is not
enough memory available.



Logging
-------






Option parsing
---------------
GNUPG does not use getopt or GNU getopt but functions of it's own.  See
util/argparse.c for details.  The advantage of these functions is that
it is more easy to display and maintain the help texts for the options.
The same option table is also used to parse resource files.



What is an IOBUF
----------------
This is the data structure used for most I/O of gnupg.	It is similar
to System V Streams but much simpler.  Because OpenPGP messages are nested
in different ways; the use of such a system has big advantages.  Here is
an example, how it works:  If the parser sees a packet header with a partial
length, it pushes the block_filter onto the IOBUF to handle these partial
length packets: from now on you don't have to worry about this.  When it sees
a compressed packet it pushes the uncompress filter and the next read byte
is one which has already been uncompressed by this filter. Same goes for
enciphered packet, plaintext packets and so on.  The file g10/encode.c
might be a good staring point to see how it is used  - actually this is
the other way: constructing messages using pushed filters but it may be
easier to understand.


How to use the message digest functions
---------------------------------------
cipher/md.c implements an interface to hash (message digest functions).

a) If you have a common part of data and some variable parts
   and you need to hash of the concatenated parts, you can use this:
	md = md_open(...)
	md_write( md,  common_part )
	md1 = md_copy( md )
	md_write(md1, part1)
	md_final(md1);
	digest1 = md_read(md1)
	md2 = md_copy( md )
	md_write(md2, part2)
	md_final(md2);
	digest2 = md_read(md2)

   An example are key signatures; the key packet is the common part
   and the user-id packets are the variable parts.

b) If you need a running digest you should use this:
	md = md_open(...)
	md_write( md, part1 )
	digest_of_part1 = md_digest( md );
	md_write( md, part2 )
	digest_of_part1_cat_part2 = md_digest( md );
	....

Both methods may be combined. [Please see the source for the real syntax]




How to use the cipher functions
-------------------------------
cipher/cipher.c implements the interface to symmetric encryption functions.
As usual you have a function to open a cipher (which returns a handle to be used
with all other functions), some functions to set the key and other stuff and
a encrypt and decrypt function which does the real work.  You probably know
how to work with files - so it should really be easy to work with these
functions.  Here is an example:

    CIPHER_HANDLE hd;

    hd = cipher_open( CIPHER_ALGO_TWOFISH, CIPHER_MODE_CFB, 0 );
    if( !hd )
	oops( use other function to check for the real error );
    rc = cipher_setkey( hd, key256bit, 32 ) )
    if( rc )
	oops( weak key or something like this );
    cipher_setiv( hd, some_IV_or_NULL_for_all_zeroes );
    cipher_encrypt( hd, plain, cipher, size );
    cipher_close( hd );



How to use the public key functions
-----------------------------------
cipher/pubkey.c implements the interface to asymmetric encryption and
signature functions. This is basically the same as with the symmetric
counterparts, but due to their nature it is a little bit more complicated.
