/* Replacement for POSIX fdopendir.

   First, try to simulate it via opendir ("/proc/self/fd/FD").  Failing
   that, simulate it by using fchdir metadata, or by doing
   save_cwd/fchdir/opendir(".")/restore_cwd.
   If either the save_cwd or the restore_cwd fails (relatively unlikely),
   then give a diagnostic and exit nonzero.

   If successful, the resulting stream is based on FD in
   implementations where streams are based on file descriptors and in
   applications where no other thread or signal handler allocates or
   frees file descriptors.  In other cases, consult dirfd on the result
   to find out whether FD is still being used.

   Otherwise, this function works just like POSIX fdopendir.

   W A R N I N G:

   Unlike other fd-related functions, this one places constraints on FD.
   If this function returns successfully, FD is under control of the
   dirent.h system, and the caller should not close or modify the state of
   FD other than by the dirent.h functions.  */

   to be a dup of FD which is less than FD - 1 and which will be
   closed by the caller and not otherwise used by the caller.  This
   function makes sure that FD is closed and all file descriptors less
   than FD are open, and then calls fd_clone_opendir on a dup of FD.
   That way, barring race conditions, fd_clone_opendir returns a
   stream whose file descriptor is FD.  */
