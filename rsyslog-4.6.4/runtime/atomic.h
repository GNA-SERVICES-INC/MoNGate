/* This header supplies atomic operations. So far, we rely on GCC's
 * atomic builtins. During configure, we check if atomic operatons are
 * available. If they are not, I am making the necessary provisioning to live without them if
 * they are not available. Please note that you should only use the macros
 * here if you think you can actually live WITHOUT an explicit atomic operation,
 * because in the non-presence of them, we simply do it without atomicitiy.
 * Which, for word-aligned data types, usually (but only usually!) should work.
 *
 * We are using the functions described in
 * http:/gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Atomic-Builtins.html
 *
 * THESE MACROS MUST ONLY BE USED WITH WORD-SIZED DATA TYPES!
