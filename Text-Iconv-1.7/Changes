Revision history for Perl extension Text::Iconv.

0.01  Sat Aug 23 16:14:12 1997
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

1.0   Sun Feb 27 16:50:11 MET 2000
	- renamed to Text::Iconv.

1.1   Mon Dec 18 00:50:45 MET 2000
	- works with Perl 5.6
	- improved and expanded test script
	- fixes core dumps with aborted conversions
	- adds experimental class attribute/method raise_error

1.2   Fri Jul 27 10:46:56 METDST 2001
	- converting undef now always returns undef
	- since HP-UX seems to be the only platform where the second
	  argument to iconv() is *not* const char**, put an #ifdef
	  into Iconv.xs

1.3   Mon Jun 28 19:25:43 CEST 2004
	- Makefile.PL now tries to detect the need for -liconv
	- added retval() method to Text::Iconv objects, which returns the
	  iconv() return value (according to the Single UNIX Specification,
	  "the number of non-identical conversions performed")
	- to make this possible, Text::Iconv objects are--on the C level--no
	  longer just the iconv handle, but a struct (which can contain other
	  information besides the handle)

1.4   Sun Jul 18 00:09:21 CEST 2004
	- Added instance attribute raise_error and corresponding
	  method to control exception raising on a per-object basis.
	- Reset shift state for state-dependent conversions.
	- Makefile.PL now passes all options besides LIBS and INC to
	  MakeMaker, so options like INSTALLDIRS=vendor work again.

1.5   Thu Aug 30 14:42:08 CEST 2007
	- Various small changes to make Text::Iconv compile on OpenVMS
	  (based on a patch by Peter (Stig) Edwards)
	- Output buffer was always initialized to 5 bytes--this was
	  just for testing, but I'd forgotten to revert back to the
	  original code (detected via a bug report by Aldo LeTellier).

1.6   Sat Oct 13 00:16:30 CEST 2007
	- Makefile.PL now uses File::Spec to portably specify the null
	  device.  This should make it possible to build Text::Iconv
	  on Windows "out of the box".
	- Added get_attr() and set_attr() methods.  They provide an
	  interface to the iconvctl() function of GNU libiconv.

1.7   Wed Oct 17 15:49:56 CEST 2007
	- Makefile.PL now explicitly declares "use 5.006;" since it
	  uses functionality like delete() for array elements.
	- In Iconv.xs, moved the variable declarations in
	  ti_set_attr() and ti_get_attr() into the PREINIT: section.
	  This makes it possible to compile it using gcc 2.96.
