Some TODOs, grouped by the individual utilty
--------------------------------------------

build
-----
	* Fix "make dist" to build documentation.
	* Fix "make distcheck" at the same time.

depmod
------
	* Kill off the "map" files. They aren't really needed any more.

modprobe
--------
	* Kill off some of the legacy options.
	* Fix grab_elf_file_fd error handling for test-module/10alias.sh.
	* Enforce use of *.conf files in /etc/modprobe.d as filename extension.
	* Add a "depends" config file directive to obviate "install" hacks.
