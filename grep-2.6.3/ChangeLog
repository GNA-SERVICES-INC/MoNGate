2010-04-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	version 2.6.3
	* NEWS: Record release date.

	grep: avoid used-undefined error with truncated multibyte input
	* src/dfa.c (addtok_wc): Don't use buf[0] (it's undefined) when
	wcrtomb returns <= 0.

	MBS_SUPPORT-removal: * src/dfa.c (dfastate):

2010-04-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	maint: avoid unnecessary 2nd getenv("TERM")
	* src/main.c (main): Don't call getenv("TERM") twice -- in the same
	expression, even.

	tests: remove all unportable uses of echo
	* src/main.c: Use printf rather than echo -ne in a comment.
	* tests/fedora: Use printf (not echo) also in ok/fail functions.
	* cfg.mk (sc_prohibit_echo_minus_en): New rule, to prohibit
	any future introduction.

	tests: add explicit requirement for en_US.UTF-8
	* tests/char-class-multibyte: Use require_en_utf8_locale_,
	rather than open-coding it.
	* tests/prefix-of-multibyte: Require the locale explicitly.
	* tests/fgrep-infloop: Likewise.
	This fixes test failures that would arise on systems without
	that particular locale.  Reported by Ludovic Courtès.

	tests: new function, to require an en_US UTF8 locale
	* tests/init.cfg (require_en_utf8_locale_): New function.

	tests: use printf, not echo -n, echo -e, or any combination
	* tests/fedora: Using printf is more portable.

	grep: remove unnecessary code
	* src/main.c (print_line_middle): Now that we use RE_ICASE
	(enabled in commit 70e23616, "dfa: rewrite handling of multibyte
	case_fold lexing"), this case-conversion code is useless and wasteful.
	Remove it.

	doc: fix typo: s/AM_V_AT/AM_V_at/
	* doc/Makefile.am (egrep.1 fgrep.1): The former has case consistent
	with its sister variable, AM_V_GEN, but the latter is the one that
	actually works.

	doc: generated files are best made read-only, ...
	...to minimize risk of accidentally modifying the generated file
	rather than its template.  These are tiny, so no risk, but it's
	a good to be consistent, so generated files are easier to spot.
	* doc/Makefile.am (egrep.1 fgrep.1): When generating these files,
	ensure that they too are created read-only.

	doc: generate grep.1 from template
	* doc/Makefile.am (grep.1): New rule.
	(CLEANFILES): Add grep.1 to the list.
	* .gitignore: Add /doc/grep.1
	* doc/grep.in.1: Replace hard-coded "2.5.1-cvs" with @VERSION@.
	Update copyright year list.
	Omit the line-splitting \(co directive so that update-copyright
	will perform future updates automatically.
	Egmont Koblinger reported the outdated version string
	and copyright year list in the man page:
	http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?29390

	doc: prepare to generate grep.1
	* doc/grep.1: Rename to...
	* doc/grep.in.1: ...this.

2010-03-29  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: make doc/Makefile.am cleaner and more robust
	* doc/Makefile.am (egrep.1 fgrep.1): Generate robustly, i.e.,
	do not redirect directly to $@.
	Use $(AM_V_GEN).
	Do not distribute intermediate files like fgrep.man and egrep.man.
	Likewise, do not use them to generate their %.1 images.
	Instead, generate the .1 files directly.

2010-03-29  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	tests: add program to detect locales
	* tests/Makefile.am (check_PROGRAMS): Add get-mb-cur-max.
	* tests/get-mb-cur-max.c: New.
	* tests/euc-mb: Use it.  Fail if the former detection test fails.
	* tests/sjis-mb: Use it.  Fail if the former detection test fails.  Expand
	comments.

	tests: add tests for SJIS character sets
	The attached test will be skipped unless (on a glibc system) you run
	something like

	  mkdir /usr/lib/locale/ja_JP.SHIFT_JIS
	  zcat /usr/share/i18n/charmaps/SHIFT_JIS.gz | \
	    localedef \
	      -f - \
	      -i /usr/share/i18n/locales/ja_JP \
	      /usr/lib/locale/ja_JP.SHIFT_JIS

	* tests/Makefile.am: Add sjis-mb.
	* tests/sjis-mb: New.

	grep -F: fix a bug with SJIS character sets
	Commit db9d6 would erroneously skip matches in SJIS character sets.  In
	this character set low bytes (i.e. ASCII bytes) are also valid second
	bytes in a double-byte character, so you have to continue looking for
	a match, even if you match in the middle of a double-byte character.

	* src/kwsearch.c: Ensure that beg is advanced by at least one byte,
	but do not fail immediately after matching in the middle of a double-byte
	character.

2010-03-29  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>

	build: update after change in gnulib's lib-ignore module
	* src/Makefile.am (AM_LDFLAGS): Define.  Use gnulib's new
	$(IGNORE_UNUSED_LIBRARIES_CFLAGS).

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

2010-03-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	grep -F: fix a multi-byte erroneous-match-in-middle bug
	Just as Perl prints nothing in this case,
	  printf '\357\274\241\n' | perl -CIO -lne '/\357/ and print'

	grep should also print nothing when used as follows.
	However, these would mistakenly match with grep prior to 2.6.2:
	  printf '\357\274\241\n' | LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 src/grep -F $'\357'
	  printf '\357\274\241\n' | LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 src/grep -F $'\357\274'

	* src/searchutils.c (is_mb_middle): New parameter: the length of the
	match, in bytes, as determined by kwsexec.  Use this to detect when
	the nominal match found by kwsexec must be skipped because it is for
	an incomplete multi-byte character that is a prefix of a character
	in the input.
	* src/dfasearch.c (EGexecute): Update caller.
	* src/kwsearch.c (Fexecute): Likewise.
	* src/search.h: Update prototype.
	* NEWS (Bug fixes): Mention it.
	Report and analysis by Norihiro Tanaka.

2010-03-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	grep -F: avoid infinite loop when searching for incomplete MB character
	Searching for an incomplete non-prefix of a multi-byte character
	should find no match.

	  Just as these print nothing,
	    printf '\357\274\241\357\274\241\n' \
	      | perl -CIO -ne '/\241\357/ and print'
	    printf '\357\274\241\n' | perl -CIO -ne '/\274\241/ and print'
	    printf '\357\274\241\n' | perl -CIO -ne '/\241/ and print'
	    printf '\357\274\241\n' | perl -CIO -ne '/\274/ and print'

	  These should also print nothing, but with grep-2.6 and grep-2.6.1,
	  they would infloop:
	    printf '\357\274\241\n' | LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 src/grep -F $'\241'
	    printf '\357\274\241\n' | LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 src/grep -F $'\274'
	    printf '\357\274\241\n' | LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 src/grep -F $'\274\241'

	* src/kwsearch.c (Fexecute): Don't infloop when searching for
	an incomplete non-prefix part of a multi-byte character.
	* NEWS (Bug fixes): Mention it.
	Reported and diagnosed by Norihiro Tanaka.

	tests: rename: fmbtest.sh -> fmbtest
	* tests/fmbtest.sh: Rename to ...
	* tests/fmbtest: ...this, dropping the .sh suffix.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Reflect renaming.

	tests: convert fmbtest.sh to use init.sh
	* tests/fmbtest.sh: Use init.sh and adapt accordingly:
	Use "grep", not ${GREP}.  Use Exit, not exit.

	tests: also exercise the --include + glob path
	* tests/include-exclude: Exercise Javier's fix.

2010-03-28  Javier Villavicencio  <the_paya@gentoo.org>

	grep -r: fix --include with globs, too
	The previous fix addressed only the non-glob case.
	* src/main.c (main): Use add_exclude's EXCLUDE_WILDCARDS option,
	to enable the use of fnmatch with --include=GLOB.
	gnulib: Update to latest, for the fixed exclude.c.

2010-03-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	grep -r: fix --include with non-globs
	* lib/savedir.c (savedir): Fix logic error.  Introduced by commit

	* tests/include-exclude: Test for this bug by exercising --include, too.
	* NEWS (Bug fixes): Mention it.

2010-03-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	kwset: correct comments; require non-NULL kwsmatch argument
	* src/kwset.c (kwsexec): Correct comments.  This function has been
	returning an offset, not a pointer, for 9 years.
	Do not test for kwsmatch == NULL.  All callers pass non-NULL.
	(cwexec): Likewise.
	* src/kwset.h (kwsexec): Mark the 4th parameter, kwsmatch, as non-NULL.
	Include "arg-nonnull.h".

	build: add -I$(top_builddir)/lib so we also find generated .h files
	* src/Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS): Rename from INCLUDES to avoid
	warning from automake -Wall.
	Add -I$(top_builddir)/lib, so we find generated .h files like
	getopt.h in a non-srcdir build.

	build: remove superfluous LOCALEDIR definition
	* src/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Remove unnecessary definition of
	LOCALEDIR here.  Now, it's defined via gnulib's configmake.h.
	* src/system.h: Include "configmake.h" for its LOCALEDIR definition.

	grep: don't segfault upon use of --include or --exclude* options
	* lib/savedir.c (isdir1): Fix fatal typo: deref "dir" argument,
	not the global (initially-NULL) "path".  Reported by Standish Parsley.
	* tests/include-exclude: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.
	* NEWS (Bug fixes): Mention it.

	tests: rename: foad1.sh -> foad1
	* tests/foad1.sh: Rename to ...
	* tests/foad1: ...this, dropping the .sh suffix.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Reflect renaming.

	tests: convert foad1.sh to use init.sh
	This fixes a spurious test failure when "make check" is run with
	certain envvars set, e.g., "make check GREP_COLOR=always"
	* tests/foad1.sh: Use init.sh and adapt accordingly:
	Use "grep", not ${GREP}.  Test VERBOSE against "yes", not "1",
	to be consistent with init.sh.
	Use Exit, not exit.
	Reported by Nelson H. F. Beebe.

	tests: insulate tests from envvar settings
	* tests/init.cfg (vars_): Unset each envvar that can affect how
	grep works.  This protects only those tests that have been
	converted to use init.sh.

2010-03-26  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	maint: ignore 'make dist pdf' droppings
	* .gitignore: Add more exemptions.

2010-03-26  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: avoid spurious test failure due to lack of a French UTF8 locale
	* tests/init.cfg: New file.  If either $LOCALE_FR or $LOCALE_FR_UTF8
	is set to "none", reset it to the empty string.
	Reported by Mike Frysinger and Sven Joachim.
	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add init.cfg.

	build: do not use pkg-config to test for PCRE support
	* configure.ac: Do not use PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG or PKG_CHECK_MODULES.
	Do not modify CPPFLAGS; that belongs to those who invoke make.
	Instead, use autoconf's AC_CHECK_HEADERS and AC_SEARCH_LIBS via the
	new macro, gl_FUNC_PCRE, defined in...
	* m4/pcre.m4 (gl_FUNC_PCRE): New macro, to handle pcre-related
	configure-time tests.
	* src/Makefile.am (grep_LDADD): Use LIB_PCRE, not PCRE_LIBS.
	* src/pcresearch.c: Test HAVE_LIBPCRE via "#if", not "#ifdef".
	All other cpp tests of this symbol used "#if".
	Prompted by a suggestion from Bruno Haible.
	* NEWS (Build-related): Mention this.

	build: use the fcntl-h module, not "fcntl"
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): We might need fcntl.h somewhere,
	but don't use the fcntl function.  Reported by Bruno Haible.

	build: avoid link failure on systems using gnulib's fcntl but not open
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Using gnulib's fcntl module
	and including <fcntl.h>, but not also using gnulib's "open" module
	would result in link failure due to references to rpl_open
	on systems requiring the replacement (e.g., Cygwin and Darwin).

	build: avoid compilation failure on systems using rpl_open
	This new build failure has arisen as a result of using gnulib's
	"fcntl" module.  Now that an inadequate "open" syscall is replace
	by gnulib's wrapper, it is essential to include <fcntl.h>.
	* src/grep.c: Include <fcntl.h>.
	This is required, for grepfile's use of open, at least on
	Cygwin and Darwin.

	maint: use gnulib's fcntl module, just in case
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add fcntl.
	Grep uses at least O_BINARY, which may be defined therein.

	maint: remove TYPE_* definitions from src/system.h
	* src/system.h (TYPE_MAXIMUM, TYPE_MINIMUM, TYPE_SIGNED): Remove
	definitions.  They are provided by intprops.h.

2010-03-20  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	build: allow compilation on cygwin
	Gnulib is incompatible with -Wunused-macros.  Addtionally,
	cygwin 1.7.1 coupled with --enable-gcc-warnings tripped on:

	grep.c: In function 'print_line_middle':
	grep.c:805: error: array subscript has type 'char' [-Wchar-subscripts]
	grep.c: In function 'main':
	grep.c:1833: error: 'optarg' redeclared without dllimport attribute: previous dllimport ignored [-Wattributes]
	grep.c:1834: error: 'optind' redeclared without dllimport attribute after being referenced with dll linkage

	* configure.ac (GNULIB_WARN_FLAGS): Disable -Wunused-macros.
	* src/grep.c (print_line_middle): Use correct type to tolower.
	(main): Drop useless redeclarations.
	* .gitignore: Ignore more built files.

	tests: ensure that all programs handle [b-a] consistently
	* tests/reversed-range-endpoints: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest
	This pulls in the latest regex module from gnulib, including a fix
	to make it honor the RE_NO_EMPTY_RANGES syntax bit.

	tests: temporarily disable irrelevant-to-grep failing C++ fcntl-h-tests
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_tool_option_extras): Temporarily add
	--avoid=fcntl-h-tests, until the C++ part of that test is fixed.

	reject reversed-endpoint ranges, with all regex variants
	* src/search.c: Add RE_NO_EMPTY_RANGES to the syntax bits
	in three places, so that all of grep, egrep, and grep -E reject
	a range with reversed endpoints like '[b-a]'.  This is required,
	when using the latest version of gnulib's regex module, since it
	now honors the RE_NO_EMPTY_RANGES flag, rather than acting as if
	it were always set.
	Based on a change by Matthew Burgess.

	* Makefile.am (cvs-clean): Remove obsolete target.

2010-03-17  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	dfa: initialize struct mbcset using memset
	* src/dfa.c (parse_bracket_exp): Use memset to initialize workmbc.

	dfa: spell out "unsigned int"
	* dfa.c (setbit, tstbit, clrbit, setbit_case_fold, lex, dfaoptimize,
	free_mbdata): Put "int" after unsigned.
	* dfa.h (struct position, struct dfa): Likewise.

	dfa: optimize simple character sets under UTF-8 charsets
	Only use a bitset when possible without involving MBCSET.  Testcase:
	   yes 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' | sed 100000q | \
	     time grep -c [ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ,]

	Before: 51ms (best of three runs); after: 16ms(best of three runs).

	* src/dfa.c (parse_bracket_exp): For simple bracket expressions
	under UTF-8, use a CSET.

	dfa: speed up handling of brackets
	This patch has two sides.  One is to fold the parsing of brackets in the
	single- and multi-byte cases.  The second is to leverage this change,
	and use a bitset to test for single-byte characters in the charset.
	Splitting the two would be very hard.

	Testcase:
	   yes 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' | sed 100000q | \
	     time grep -c [ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ,]

	Before: 59ms (best of three runs); after: 51ms (best of three runs).
	Nice, but mostly providing infrastructure for the next patch.

	* src/dfa.c (setbit_case_fold): Try applying towlower/towupper.
	(looking_at): Remove.
	(FETCH_WC): New.
	(fetch_wc): Merge into FETCH_WC [MBS_SUPPORT].
	(FETCH) [MBS_SUPPORT]: Call FETCH_WC.
	(prednames, find_pred, is_blank and other predicates): Move above,
	remove K&R syntax support.
	(parse_bracket_exp): New name of parse_bracket_exp_mb, rewritten to
	include single-byte character set parsing of brackets.
	(lex): Adjust for fetch_wc->FETCH_WC change, remove single-byte
	character set parsing of brackets.
	(match_mb_charset): Test against work_mbc->cset.
	* src/dfa.h (struct mb_char_classes): Add cset.

	syntax-check: remove space-tab exception
	* .x-sc_space_tab: Remove.
	* src/dfa.c: Fix space-tab occurrence.

	THANKS: fix Jim Meyering's email address
	* THANKS: Jim is now with Red Hat.

	dfa: add missing function
	* src/dfa.c (using_utf8): New.
	(addtok_wc, free_mbdata, dfaoptimize) [!MBS_SUPPORT]: Do not define.
	(dfacomp) [!MBS_SUPPORT]: Do not call dfaoptimize.

	tests: fix typo
	* fedora: Fix typo.

	tests: use Exit
	* euc-mb: exit with "Exit 0".

	grep: remove more register keywords
	* dosbuf.c: Remove register keywords.
	* grep.c: Remove register keywords.
	* kwset.c: Remove register keywords.
	* search.c: Remove register keywords.

	dfa: run simple UTF-8 regexps as a single-byte character set
	This provides a speedup whenever fgrep is "almost" sufficient but
	not quite (e.g. grep ^abc).  This affects test cases such as
	https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?29117, which are already worked around
	by the line-by-line matching patch c32c04; without that patch the
	speedup can reach 1000x even on non-contrived testcases.

	* src/dfa.c (dfaoptimize): New.
	(dfacomp): Call it.

	tests: fix syntax-check failures
	* tests/case-fold-backref: Use "foo" instead of "the".
	* tests/dfaexec-multibyte: Remove trailing blanks.

	grep: remove check_multibyte_string, fix non-UTF8 missed match
	Avoid computing ahead something that can be computed lazily as efficiently
	(or more efficiently in the case of UTF-8, though this is left as TODO).
	At the same time, "soften" the rejection condition for matching in the
	middle of a multibyte sequence to fix bug 23814.

	Multibyte "grep -i" would still be very slow if it wasn't for the workaround
	patch c32c042 (grep: match multibyte charsets line-by-line when using -i,
	2010-03-08).

	* NEWS: Document bugfix.
	* src/search.c (check_multibyte_string): Rewrite as...
	(is_mb_middle): ... this.
	(EGexecute, Fexecute): Adjust.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add euc-mb.
	* tests/euc-mb: New testcase.

	dfa: cache MB_CUR_MAX for dfaexec
	* src/dfa.c (state_index, dfaexec): Use d->mb_cur_max.
	(dfainit): Initialize it.
	(free_mbdata): New, extracted out of dfafree.
	(dfafree): Use it.

	dfa: improve documentation of struct dfa
	* src/dfa.h (struct dfa): Reword some comments.

	tests: factor name of output files into a variable
	* tests/case-fold-backref, tests/case-fold-char-class,
	tests/case-fold-char-range, tests/case-fold-char-type,
	tests/dfaexec-multibyte: Use a variable for the output filename,
	as it is common to the grep and compare invocations.

	tests: use different output files to simplify reading failed .log files
	* tests/case-fold-backref, tests/case-fold-char-class,
	tests/case-fold-char-range, tests/case-fold-char-type: Use a different
	name for each output file from grep.
	* tests/dfaexec-multibyte: Likewise, and merge some grep invocations.

	tests: add another grep -i testcase, from bug 16179
	* tests/case-fold-backref: New.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

	dfa: rewrite handling of multibyte case_fold lexing
	Let dfacomp do the folding to lowercase of multibyte input strings,
	and remove it from grep.c.  Input strings to kwset.c are still folded
	outside kwset.c, so we still need to do mbtolower in search.c.

	* NEWS: Document bugfixes.
	* .x-sc_cast_of_argument_to_free: Remove.
	* src/dfa.c (wctok, addtok_wc): New.
	(cur_mb_index, update_mb_len_index): Remove.
	(FETCH): Do not call it.
	(parse_bracket_exp_mb) [GREP]: Disable case-folding of ranges and
	characters.
	(addtok): Extract part to...
	(addtok_mb): ... this new function.
	(lex): Call fetch_wc in the main loop for MB_CUR_MAX > 1.  Return WCHAR
	for normal characters if MB_CUR_MAX > 1.
	(atom): Handle WCHAR instead of treating multibyte characters specially.
	Do case folding of multibyte characters here.
	(dfacomp): Remove case_fold special casing.
	* src/dfa.h (WCHAR): New.
	* src/grep.c (mb_icase_keys): Remove.
	(main): Do not call it.
	* src/search.c (kwsinit): Init transition table only for MB_CUR_MAX == 1.
	(mbtolower): New.
	(kwsincr_case): New.
	(kwsmusts): Call it instead of kwsincr.
	(check_multibyte_string): Remove.
	(check_multibyte_string_no_icase): Rename to check_multibyte_string.
	(GEAcompile, EGexecute, Fcompile): Use mbtolower instead of the old
	check_multibyte_string.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add case-fold-backslash-w.
	* tests/foad1.sh: Enable fixed tests.
	* tests/case-fold-backslash-w: New.

2010-03-16  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	grep: match multibyte charsets line-by-line when using -i
	The turtle combination -i + MB_CUR_MAX>1 requires case conversion ahead
	of time.  Avoid doing this repeatedly when many matches succeed.  Together
	with the previous changes, this fixes https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?29117
	and https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?14472.

	* NEWS: Document new speedup.
	* src/grep.c (do_execute): New.

	* tests/case-fold-char-range: New.

	tests: add more UTF-8 test cases

	tests: complete the renaming fedora.sh -> fedora
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Rename fedora.sh -> fedora here, too.

	* tests/fedora.sh: Rename to...
	* tests/fedora: ...this, to reflect new convention:
	Use the lack of a suffix to indicate we've converted to the new
	init.sh-using test framework.

	tests: adjust fedora.sh to handle traps more portably

	tests: adjust fedora.sh to handle traps more portably
	* tests/fedora.sh: Use "Exit", not "exit".

	tests: for each test, set an envvar to its name
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Set GREP_TEST_NAME for
	each test.  This is used to help make the output of hundreds of
	independent, often-parallel valgrind runs more manageable.

2010-03-14  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: clean up fedora.sh
	* tests/fedora.sh: Use "grep", not ${GREP}.
	Use init.sh.
	Use timeout 10, not sleep 1 (three times).
	The latter would always sleep for 3 seconds, and the test would
	fail with a false positive on a slow system or with a heavily
	instrumented (valgrind) executable.

	do not cast free argument to ptr_t or char *.
	(freelist): Call free instead of ifree.
	* src/dfa.h (ptr_t): Remove.

	dfa: remove CRANGE dead code
	The only use of CRANGE was removed by commit 193830d.  In theory it is
	more correct to do what CRANGE did, but in practice it seems like it did
	not work.

	* src/dfa.h (token): Remove CRANGE.
	* src/dfa.c (atom): Do not handle CRANGE.
	(prtok): Likewise.

	dfa: get rid of x*alloc
	* src/dfa.c: Include xalloc.h.
	(xmalloc, xrealloc, xcalloc): Remove.

	grep: cleanup one const cast
	* src/search.c (GEAcompile): Do not reuse motif when operating on the
	(const) pattern, so we can make it non-const.  Remove cast from free.

	kwset/system: remove ptr_t
	* src/kwset.h: Declare kwset using an incomplete struct type.
	* src/system.h (ptr_t): Remove.

2010-03-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: add test cases for dfaexec bug
	* tests/dfaexec-multibyte: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.
	Reported by Paolo Bonzini in http://bugzilla.redhat.com/544407
	and http://bugzilla.redhat.com/544406 .

	dfa: manually merge gawk's dfaexec
	* src/dfa.c (dfaexec): Adjust API: return pointer, not offset, and
	take an "end" pointer parameter, rather than integral "size".
	Adjust comment accordingly.
	(build_state): Maintain d->newlines.
	(copytoks): Update multibyte_prop indices.
	(SKIP_REMAINS_MB_IF_INITIAL_STATE): Update a cast.
	Return NULL, rather than (size_t) -1.
	(realloc_trans_if_necessary): Realloc d->newlines.
	* src/dfa.h (struct dfa): New member, "newlines".
	(struct dfa) [GAWK]: New member, "broken".
	(dfaexec): Update prototype and copy the new comment from dfa.c.

	dfa: make search.c use the new dfaexec API

	* src/search.c: Adjust to new dfaexec API.
	Now, dfaexec returns a pointer, not an integer,
	and the third parameter is END, not buffer size.
	* src/dfa.c (dfaexec): Rewrite the function's comment.
	Don't just clobber *END.  While doing that happens to be
	fine for gawk's usage, in grep, *END usually points to the
	first byte of the next buffer.  Save the initial value,
	and restore it just before returning.
	* src/dfa.h (dfaexec): Update comment; include parameter names.

	dfa: appease static analyzers
	* src/dfa.c (transit_state_singlebyte): Call abort rather
	than returning in a "can't happen" scenario.
	This stops clang from emitting a false-positive report (I think it
	was used-uninitialized) about a caller.

2010-03-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	dfa: do not accept [[:UPPER:]] or [[:LOWER:]] internally
	* src/dfa.c (parse_bracket_exp_mb): Those class names are not
	valid, and rejected elsewhere, so there is no point in allowing
	upper or mixed-case versions here.

	maint: remove a trailing space
	* src/search.c (EXECUTE_FCT): Remove trailing space.

	maint: remove all uses of PARAMS
	Remove most with this:
	git grep -lw PARAMS |xargs perl -pi -e 's/\bPARAMS *\((.*)\);/$1;/'
	Remove the remainder manually.

	maint: remove all uses of PARAMS
	* lib/savedir.h (PARAMS): Remove definitions manually.
	Remove the remaining ones via this command:
	  git grep -l define.PARAMS |xargs perl -ni -e '/define PARAMS/ or print'
	* src/dfa.h (PARAMS): Remove definitions.

	when it's empty, not just when it's undefined.
	There are still relatively harmless leaks when GREP_OPTIONS
	is set and non-empty.  We'll address those, eventually.

	eliminate invalid "ptr += (ptr2 - ptr1)"
	* lib/savedir.c (savedir): new_name_space and name_space do not point into

	point into different objects.  Avoid this.

	fix for bug 21276
	* lib/savedir.c (isdir1): Use realloc instead of calloc.  Remove
	dead code.
	(savedir): Do not leak name_space if allocation of new_name_space fails.

	Now that we enable more warnings in lib/, we choose

	ok, since we know the input is a valid upper case wide character.

	to use both it and check_multibyte_string_no_icase.

	maint: avoid warnings about unused fwrite return value
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add unlocked-io.
	* src/system.h: Include "unlocked-io.h".

	maint: remove {m4,lib}/.gitignore; they were undergoing too much churn
