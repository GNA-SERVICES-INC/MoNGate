.SH SYNOPSIS

.RI [ ENV ]...
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B started
event is generated by the Upstart
.BR init (8)
daemon when an instance of a job has finished starting and is now running.  The
.B JOB
environment variable contains the job name, and the
.B INSTANCE
environment variable contains the instance name which will be empty for
single-instance jobs.

.BR init (8)
emits this event as an informational signal, services and tasks started
or stopped by this event will do so in parallel with other activity.  It
is typically combined with the
.BR stopping (7)
event by services declaring a dependency.

Job configuration files may use the
.B export
stanza to export environment variables from their own environment into
the
.B started
event.  See
.BR init (5)
for more details.
