.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B stopped
event is generated by the Upstart
.BR init (8)
daemon when an instance of a job has stopped.  The
.B JOB
environment variable contains the job name, and the
.B INSTANCE
environment variable contains the instance name which will be empty for
single-instance jobs.

If the job was stopped normally, the
.B RESULT
environment variable will be
.IR ok ,
otherwise if the job was stopped because it has failed it will be
.IR failed .

When the job has failed, the process that failed will be given in the
.B PROCESS
environment variable.  This may be
.IR pre-start ", " post-start ", " main ", " pre-stop " or " post-stop ;
it may also be the special value
.I respawn
to indicate that the job was stopped because it hit the respawn limit.

Finally in the case of a failed job, one of either
.B EXIT_STATUS
or
.B EXIT_SIGNAL
may be given to indicate the cause of the stop.  Either
.B EXIT_STATUS
will contain the exit status code of the process, or
.B EXIT_SIGNAL
will contain the name of the signal that the process received.  The
.B normal exit
job configuration stanza can be used to prevent particular exit status
values or signals resulting in a failed job, see
.BR init (5)
for more information.

If neither
.B EXIT_STATUS
or
.B EXIT_SIGNAL
is given for a failed process, it is because the process failed to spawn
(for example, file not found).  See the system logs for the error.

.BR init (8)
emits this event as an informational signal, services and tasks started
or stopped by this event will do so in parallel with other activity.  It
is typically combined with the
.BR starting (7)
event by services when inserting themselves as a dependency.

Job configuration files may use the
.B export
stanza to export environment variables from their own environment into
the
.B stopped
event.  See
.BR init (5)
for more details.
