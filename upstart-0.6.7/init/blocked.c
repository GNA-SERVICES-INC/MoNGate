/**
 * blocked_new:
 * @parent: parent of blocked structure,
 * @type: type of object blocked,
 * @data: pointer to object.
 *
 * Allocates a Blocked structure for the object details given, which is
 * normally appended to the caller's own blocking list.  It is also up
 * to the called to ensure that the object is aware of the block, and handle
 * unblocking the object when done.
 *
 * If @parent is not NULL, it should be a pointer to another allocated
 * block which will be used as the parent for this block.  When @parent
 * is freed, the returned block will be freed too.
 *
 * Returns: new Blocked structure or NULL if insufficient memory.
