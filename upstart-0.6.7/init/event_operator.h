 * @event: event matched (EVENT_MATCH only).
 *
 * This structure is used to build up an event expression tree; the leaf
 * nodes are all of EVENT_MATCH type which match a specific event, the other
 * nodes are built up of EVENT_OR and EVENT_AND operators that combine the
 * EventOperators to their left and right in interesting ways.
 *
 * @value indicates whether this operator is currently TRUE or FALSE.
 * For EVENT_MATCH operators, a TRUE @value means that @event is set to
 * the matched event; for EVENT_OR and EVENT_AND operators, @value is set
 * depending on the value of both immediate children.
 *
 * Once an event has been matched, the @event member is set and a reference
 * held until the structure is cleared.
