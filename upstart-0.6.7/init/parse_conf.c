 * @conffile: configuration file being parsed,
 * @file: file or string to parse,
 * @len: length of @file,
 * @pos: offset within @file,
 * @lineno: line number.
 *
 * This function is used to parse a job definition from @file, taking the
 * name from the stanza itself.  A block is expected containing a sequence
 * of stanzas is expected, defining the parameters of the job.
 *
 * The necessary configuration item is allocated and attached to the file

 * Returns: zero on success, negative value on raised error.
