The methods used to eject are mostly Linux specific. A version for
SunOS or Solaris could likely be done by stripping out much of the
code.

It should compile as is on all Linux platforms.  Support for long
option names requires the GNU getopt_long functions.  It also needs
the POSIX regex functions, which I would think are included in most
Linux distributions.
