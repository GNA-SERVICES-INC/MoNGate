.HP \w'\fBsu\fR\ 'u
\fBsu\fR [\fIopzioni\fR] [\fIusername\fR]
.SH "DESCRIZIONE"
.PP
The
\fBsu\fR
command is used to become another user during a login session\&. Invoked without a
\fBusername\fR,
\fBsu\fR
defaults to becoming the superuser\&. The optional argument
\fB\-\fR
may be used to provide an environment similar to what the user would expect had the user logged in directly\&.
.PP
Dopo il nome utente, \(`e possibile specificare argomenti aggiuntivi da passare alla shell di login dell\*(Aqutente\&. In particolare, molti interpreti di comando adottano la convenzione per cui l\*(Aqopzione
\fB\-c\fR
seguita da un argomento fa s\(`i che quest\*(Aqultimo sia considerato un comando\&.Il comando viene eseguito dalla shell specificata in
/etc/passwd
per l\*(Aqutente di destinazione\&.
.PP
You can use the
\fB\-\-\fR
argument to separate
\fBsu\fR
options from the arguments supplied to the shell\&.
.PP
All\*(Aqutente viene quindi chiesta la password, se necessario\&. Una password errata viene segnalata da un messaggio d\*(Aqerrore\&. Viene effettuato il log di tutti i tentativi, siano essi riusciti o meno, al fine di rilevare ogni abuso del sistema\&.
.PP
The current environment is passed to the new shell\&. The value of
\fB$PATH\fR
is reset to
/bin:/usr/bin
for normal users, or
/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
for the superuser\&. This may be changed with the
\fBENV_PATH\fR
and
\fBENV_SUPATH\fR
definitions in
/etc/login\&.defs\&.
.PP
A subsystem login is indicated by the presence of a "*" as the first character of the login shell\&. The given home directory will be used as the root of a new file system which the user is actually logged into\&.
.SH "OPZIONI"
.PP

.sp
When
\fB\-\fR

\fBsu\fR
option\&. The other forms (\fB\-l\fR
and
\fB\-\-login\fR) do not have this restriction\&.

/etc/passwd
entry for the target user\&.
.RE
.PP
.RS 4

.RE
.sp
If the target user has a restricted shell (i\&.e\&. the shell field of this user\*(Aqs entry in
/etc/passwd
is not listed in
/etc/shell), then the
\fB\-\-shell\fR
option or the
\fB$SHELL\fR
environment variable won\*(Aqt be taken into account, unless
\fBsu\fR
is called by root\&.
.RE

.RE
.PP
\fB$IFS\fR
.RS 4
reset to
\(Fo<space><tab><newline>\(Fc, if it was set\&.
.RE
.sp
If the target user has a restricted shell, this option has no effect (unless
\fBsu\fR
is called by root)\&.
.sp
Note that the default behavior for the environment is the following:
.PP
.RS 4
The
\fB$HOME\fR,
\fB$SHELL\fR,
\fB$USER\fR,
\fB$LOGNAME\fR,
\fB$PATH\fR, and
