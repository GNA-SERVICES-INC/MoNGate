    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para>
      <filename>/var/log/faillog</filename> maintains a count of login
      failures and the limits for each account.
    </para>
    <para>
      The file contains fixed length
      records, indexed by numerical UID. Each record contains the count of
      login failures since the last successful login; the maximum number of
      failures before the account is disabled; the line on whiche the last login
      failure occurred; the date of the last login failure;
      and the duration (in seconds) during which the account will be locked after
      a failure.
    </para>

    <para>The structure of the file is:</para>
      <programlisting>
struct	faillog {
	short   fail_cnt;
