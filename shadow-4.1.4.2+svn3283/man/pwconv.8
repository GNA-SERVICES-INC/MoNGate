.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBpwconv\fR
command creates
\fIshadow\fR
from
\fIpasswd\fR
and an optionally existing
\fIshadow\fR\&.
.PP
The
\fBpwunconv\fR
command creates
\fIpasswd\fR
from
\fIpasswd\fR
and
\fIshadow\fR
and then removes
\fIshadow\fR\&.
.PP
The
\fBgrpconv\fR
command creates
\fIgshadow\fR
from
\fIgroup\fR
and an optionally existing
\fIgshadow\fR\&.
.PP
The
\fBgrpunconv\fR
command creates
\fIgroup\fR
from
\fIgroup\fR
and
\fIgshadow\fR
and then removes
\fIgshadow\fR\&.
.PP
These four programs all operate on the normal and shadow password and group files:
/etc/passwd,
/etc/group,
/etc/shadow, and
/etc/gshadow\&.
.PP
Each program acquires the necessary locks before conversion\&.
\fBpwconv\fR
and
\fBgrpconv\fR
are similar\&. First, entries in the shadowed file which don\*(Aqt exist in the main file are removed\&. Then, shadowed entries which don\*(Aqt have `x\*(Aq as the password in the main file are updated\&. Any missing shadowed entries are added\&. Finally, passwords in the main file are replaced with `x\*(Aq\&. These programs can be used for initial conversion as well to update the shadowed file if the main file is edited by hand\&.
.PP

\fBpwconv\fR
will use the values of
\fIPASS_MIN_DAYS\fR,
\fIPASS_MAX_DAYS\fR, and
\fIPASS_WARN_AGE\fR
from
/etc/login\&.defs
when adding new entries to
/etc/shadow\&.
.PP
Likewise
\fBpwunconv\fR
and
\fBgrpunconv\fR
are similar\&. Passwords in the main file are updated from the shadowed file\&. Entries which exist in the main file but not in the shadowed file are left alone\&. Finally, the shadowed file is removed\&. Some password aging information is lost by
\fBpwunconv\fR\&. It will convert what it can\&.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
Errors in the password or group files (such as invalid or duplicate entries) may cause these programs to loop forever or fail in other strange ways\&. Please run
\fBpwck\fR
and
\fBgrpck\fR
to correct any such errors before converting to or from shadow passwords or groups\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
The following configuration variable in
/etc/login\&.defs
changes the behavior of
\fBgrpconv\fR
and
\fBgrpunconv\fR:
.PP
\fBMAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP\fR (number)
.RS 4
Maximum members per group entry\&. When the maximum is reached, a new group entry (line) is started in
/etc/group
(with the same name, same password, and same GID)\&.
.sp
The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits in the number of members in a group\&.
.sp
This feature (split group) permits to limit the length of lines in the group file\&. This is useful to make sure that lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024 characters\&.
.sp
If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25\&.
.sp
Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools (even in the Shadow toolsuite)\&. You should not use this variable unless you really need it\&.
.RE
.PP
The following configuration variables in
/etc/login\&.defs
change the behavior of
\fBpwconv\fR:
.PP
\fBPASS_MAX_DAYS\fR (number)
.RS 4
The maximum number of days a password may be used\&. If the password is older than this, a password change will be forced\&. If not specified, \-1 will be assumed (which disables the restriction)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBPASS_MIN_DAYS\fR (number)
.RS 4
The minimum number of days allowed between password changes\&. Any password changes attempted sooner than this will be rejected\&. If not specified, \-1 will be assumed (which disables the restriction)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBPASS_WARN_AGE\fR (number)
.RS 4
The number of days warning given before a password expires\&. A zero means warning is given only upon the day of expiration, a negative value means no warning is given\&. If not specified, no warning will be provided\&.
.RE
.SH "FILES"
.PP
/etc/login\&.defs
.RS 4
Shadow password suite configuration\&.
.RE
.SH "SEE ALSO"
