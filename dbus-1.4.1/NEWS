D-Bus 1.4.1 (20 December 2010)
==

 • Fix for CVE-2010-4352: sending messages with excessively-nested variants can
   crash the bus. The existing restriction to 64-levels of nesting previously
   only applied to the static type signature; now it also applies to dynamic
   nesting using variants. Thanks to Rémi Denis-Courmont for discoving this
   issue.
